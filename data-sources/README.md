# Terraform Route53 Domain Mapping with Existing Load Balancer

This Terraform setup shows how to point a custom domain (like `aaqib.com`) to an **already existing** AWS Application Load Balancer using **Route 53** and **Terraform data sources**.

## ‚ùì Question

**Q:- I already have an existing AWS Load Balancer. Now I want to point a domain (aaqib.com) to it using Route 53. The value should be the DNS name of the existing Load Balancer. How can I do this with Terraform?**
